NOTE1: This file takes several minutes to open depending on the speed of your computer. 
It has to go through a folder of 1000 images and cache them all in a 3d textuer TOP. 
This takes time. Be sure you have at least a gig of video memory. More is better if you plan to push the boundaries or resolution of the tiles.




NOTE2: I did not personally vet or put together the image library
used in example 1 - it is a 1000 desktop wallpaper dump from IMGUR

Most seem harmless at a glance but you may want to look through
these if you are at work or in a professional setting to make sure
nothing you deem inappropriate may find it's way mapped onto
your forehead etc ;)
